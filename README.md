# deeplearning_rnn
Make modules, in which encoder-decoder, autoencoder, deep boltzman machines, attention networks, word2vec are implemented in a very understandable way using tensorflow

# Tools Used
To implement variational inferences, tensorflow probability is used.
For building model and computation tensorflow is used.
All code is written in python

Currently this is a work in progress and if anyone has faced any issues while implementing these, they can mention in comments and we will try to address those issues.
