# deeplearning_rnn
Make a module, in which encoder-decoder, autoencoder, deep boltzman machines, attention networks, word2vec are implemented in a very understandable way using tensorflow

Currently this is a work in progress and if anyone has faced any issues while implementing these, they can mention in comments and we will try to address those issues.
